# Exploring Insights from the Largest US Companies

## Overview
The project is about creating an interactive web application that uses  datasets containing information about the largest companies in the United States by revenue, profits, and market value as compiled by the Fortune 500 ranking in 2021 and 2022. This application will be developed using various technologies such as Python Flask for the backend, HTML/CSS and JavaScript for the front end, and a chosen database (SQL) to store and manage the dataset.

The main goal of the project is to provide users with a visually engaging and informative platform to explore and understand the significance of these large US companies within the corporate landscape. The application will feature various data visualizations that present insights from the dataset, highlighting different aspects of the companies' revenues, industries, and other relevant information.

•	Informed Decision-Making: Professionals, investors, and policymakers can make strategic choices based on data-driven insights.

•	Educational Value: Researchers can study real-world financial applications.

•	Comparative Insights: Users can compare companies and industries, revealing trends and competition.

•	Engagement: Interactive elements enhance user engagement and data exploration.

### Required Project Files For Analysis:
**raw data folder:** We'll collect these datasets from Kaggle [(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/fortune-1000-companieslatest)],    
 [(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/winston56/fortune-500-data-2021)]

In this folder,
- Fortune_1000.csv
- fortune_1000_2021.csv
- fortune_1000_2022.csv

**Resources Folder:** In this folder,
 
1: We have 3 cleaned CSV files:

- company_data_2021.csv
- company_data_2022.csv
- all_company_location.csv

3: Another csv file named **company_location.csv** which contains all companies location  

4: We created our final CSV file named **company_data.csv** using an SQL JOIN query to combine the three cleaned CSV files for further analysis.

### Research Questions We'll Explore in this Project:
-  Which state seems to be a hotspot for top-performing companies in 2021 based on revenue?
  
-  How does the revenue distribution change among the top 15 revenue companies for different selected years?
  
-  What is the contribution of each sector to the total revenue generated by the top 15 companies for a specific year?
  
- How are revenue, profits, and market value correlated among the top 15 companies for a given year?
  
- How does the market value of companies affect the size of bubbles in the bubble chart?
  
- How do the revenue figures of the top 100 companies with female CEOs compare in different selected years?
  
- Among the top 100 companies with female CEOs, which industries are most prominent in terms of revenue generation?
  
- Is there a correlation between the number of employees and the revenue for the top 100 companies with female CEOs?
  
- Do larger employee counts generally correspond to higher revenues, or are there exceptions?
  
-  In which geographic locations are the top 20 companies of 2021 primarily located?

 ### Project Work:
**Step 1:** Once we cleaned the dataset with Jupyter Notebook, we made an ERD Diagram using  [(https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/)] to design the SQL schema and properly set data types for all columns.

**Step 2:** We used pgAdmin4 to build tables and combine datasets. This helped us create a single database for our Flask APIs. By joining the three datasets on the "Company" field, we picked the right columns to prevent duplicate values

**Step 3:** Once our database is created, we convert it into a CSV file named "company_data.csv" using Python Flask API routes. This allows us to retrieve the JSON and GeoJSON URLs as well as the JSON and GeoJSON data, which are used to create our interactive visualization.

**Step 4:** Create Interactive Visualization

#### Create an Interactive Dashboard for exploring Top US Companies Insights
